<h1> The Sociability of Capybaras </hr>
<h3> <p> Capybaras tend to live in groups consisting of females, males and even children. These groupings allow for stability and peace for Capybaras. It is interesting that the rules that usually work where dominant capybaras are more successful and social in mating than more submissive males in the wild are completely opposite within these groups. <br> <br> <br>
Due to the lack of competition for prey like carnivorous animals may experience, capybaras are generally less aggressive in the wild. Therefore, they are very relaxed and calm when in the presence of other animals like dogs and cats, and luckily even humans! Even if they weren't completely harmless, it would be difficult to not want to be near a capybara due to their always-present smiles and cute button noses. </p> <br>
