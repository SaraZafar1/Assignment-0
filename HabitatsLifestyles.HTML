<h1> The Habitats and lifestyles of Capybaras </hr> 
<h3> <p> Capybaras are located in Panama, Colombia, Venezuela, Guyana, Peru, Paraguay, Argentina, and Uruguay. They thrive in areas that include some kind of bodies of water like lakes or rivers, and basically any place within their regions that have regular rainfall. Capybaras need <i> wide </i> spaces to allow them the exercise and comfortability that they need to survive. So, if you'd like to keep a capybara as a pet, ensure that these parameters are met to keep them happy and safe. <br> <br> <br>
A characteristic of the capybara lifestyle is that they are semi-aquatic. This only justifies their need for water in their habitat. Not only this, but, like children, capybaras tend to take frequent naps throughout the day. Even if slightly disturbed, they retain their cool, composed disposition. <br> <br>
