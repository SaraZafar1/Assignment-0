<h2> <center> Capybaras are very sociable to all creatures as well! </h2> </center> 
<h3> <br> 
The only time capybaras show aggression is when they are provoked, and they always bite back. <br> <br> <br>
Other than that, they are basically always peaceable! <br> <br> <br>

<h2> Lastly, Capybaras have very strict diets! </h2> 
<h3> <br> 
Even as herbivores who don't have to compete for prey, they still need an optimal diet. <br> <br> <br>
One of these things is access to fresh water and grass to train their sharp teeth 24/7. <br> <br> <br> <br> <hr>
